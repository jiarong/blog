N Cycle Meeting Discussion Results
##################################

The nitrogen cycle can be measure in two aspects::

Pools
  Concentration or amount of chemical involved in the cycle.

Dynamics
  Kinetics of the processes. Gene markers of enzymes involved in the processes can be used to measure dynamics.

Figure 1 shows a brief N-cycle diagram. Pools that can be currently measured at marked with triangle and gaps (either pools or dynamics) are marked with stars.

As shown in Table 1, genes of key enzymes in |N2| fixation, denitrification, and nitrification are listed. The ones with boldface have already been used to study GLBRC samples. These gene markers can be study in three aspacts:

- gene counts
- expression
- sequence diveristy


.. Substitution def
.. |N2| replace:: N\ :sub:`2`\ 
.. |NH3| replace:: NH\ :sub:`3`\ 
.. |NO3-| replace:: NO\ :sub:`3`\ :sup:`-`\ 
.. |NO2-| replace:: NO\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`-`\ 
.. |N2O| replace:: N\ :sub:`2`\ O
.. |NH2OH| replace:: NH\ :sub:`2`\ OH
